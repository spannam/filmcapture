Your code is a bit sloppy… try to keep indenting clean and things tight with very little
space between lines so it's easy to edit. Be sure your margins are all the same, at
places, your content is not aligned vertically and it disrupts the cleanliness of the page.A
good effort here, focus on using typography sensitively and on clean alignments. Keep
going!
